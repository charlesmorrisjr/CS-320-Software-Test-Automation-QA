# CS-320-Software-Test-Automation-QA

In this course, I learned that testing is important for ensuring that my code is functional and secure. For every Java class file, I created a corresponding test file. The test file checked every conditional and function in the Java class to ensure that it was impossible to run the code with invalid data. The code would either throw an error or print an error to the console.



How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?

In this course, I learned that testing is necessary for ensuring that my code is functional and secure. For every Java class file, I created a corresponding test file. The test file checked every conditional and function in the Java class to ensure that it was impossible to run the code with invalid data. The code would either throw an error or print an error to the console.

It's essential to ensure the user's requirements are correctly implemented when developing software. In this course, I was asked to create a class to hold contact information. Each type of information, such as ID, name, or address, had different restrictions as to what data could be entered. For example, the ID needed to be a unique string ten characters long and could not be null or updatable. To fulfill this, I wrote code to generate a random string of characters for the ID each time a new contact object was created. The user could not manually enter an invalid ID.

When designing software, it's vital to ensure it is user-friendly and efficient. Proper software testing is necessary to ensure that the design is implemented properly, fulfilling all user requirements while remaining error-free.
